# At the Ising critical point (J = h_x) with a small longitudinal tilt
# h_z, the TFIML spectrum follows E8 scattering theory (Zamolodchikov
# 1989). In the thermodynamic limit the first two single-particle
# masses satisfy
#
#     m2 / m1 = 2 cos(π/5) = golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618…
#
# This test probes the low-energy sector with ITensorMPS.dmrg_x, which
# targets eigenstates by maximum overlap to an initial MPS. dmrg_x is
# designed for MBL / localised spectra; at a gapless critical point
# the collective low-lying modes are not product-like and dmrg_x is
# not expected to cleanly resolve m1 / m2. The ratio assertion is
# therefore marked @test_broken so the observed value is logged
# without failing CI — flip it to @test once a more suitable solver
# (excited-state DMRG with orthogonal penalty, Lanczos, …) is wired in.
