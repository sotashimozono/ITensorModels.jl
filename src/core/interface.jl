    bond_term(model::AbstractLatticeModel, i::Int, j::Int) -> OpSum

Local piece of the Hamiltonian associated with the bond between physical
positions `i` and `j`. Implementations should distribute on-site terms
**symmetrically with half weight on each endpoint** so that summing
`bond_term` over every consecutive pair in a chain reproduces the
`:bulk_half_edge` convention (each interior phys site accumulates the
full on-site weight from two adjacent bonds, while the two end sites
retain half weight).

This is the local energy density: `⟨ψ|MPO(bond_term(m, i, j), sites)|ψ⟩`
is the energy on bond `(i, j)` and nearby sites.

"""
    boundary_patch(model::AbstractLatticeModel, i::Int) -> OpSum

Extra on-site contribution added at the two boundary phys sites when
`build_opsum` is called with `boundary = :full`. Default: empty
`OpSum()`. Override to supply the missing half-weight on-site terms so
that summing `bond_term`s over all bonds plus `boundary_patch`es at both
ends reproduces the plain-chain Hamiltonian.

    local_ham_terms(model, phys_sites; boundary=:bulk_half_edge) -> Vector{OpSum}

Ordered list of local Hamiltonian pieces whose sum is the full MPO.
The first `length(phys_sites)-1` entries are `bond_term(model, phys_sites[k], phys_sites[k+1])`;
for `boundary = :full` two extra `boundary_patch` entries are appended.

Useful directly for local observables (bond-resolved energy density,
per-site magnetisation from the relevant piece, …).
